project: Demage/defective Spots on Solar-Panels segmentation using Deeplab3+ (drone-image dataset of solar panels)

Project Instructions By Client:...

she said nope, deeplabv3+ must with resnet101 backbone is a must also

I want to compare or improve this DeepLabv3+ model using CRF as post-processing. 
My hypothesis is that using CRF should give better results. 
The object being studied is DeepLabv3+ for detecting hotspots on solar panels. 
So basically, I want to see which method is the most effective for hotspot detection using that model.


Developing an image-processing pipeline using the DeepLabV3+ architecture with a drone-image dataset of solar panels. 
The output includes a comparison between DeepLabV3+ with Conditional Random Field (CRF) post-processing and without CRF. 
The evaluation metrics will include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
The final output also includes visual results showing the detected target points based on the dataset’s ground-truth labels.

"i already have the dataset: with training-subset: 518 with mask_PNG's  and val-subset: 130 with mask_png's for each .jpg image...

“Later, the output should look like that: the ground truth/mask on the left, the Deeplabv3+ result in the middle, and the CRF-refined output on the right.
There will also be a metrics report comparing the performance of Deeplabv3+ without CRF and with CRF.”


its like segmentation...
The dataset already includes the masks... and there are just two classes 0 bg(by default) and 1 defective class(target-> need to be segmented by model).


The masks indicate the location of specific points that the model needs to predict. 
For example, the green box is the reference area the model must predict or re-create. 
The red box is the prediction result from Deeplabv3+, 
and the blue box is the prediction result from Deeplabv3+ with CRF.”

“Basically, it's the visualization of the model’s prediction results compared to the ground truth, along with the metrics. 
The whole point is just to compare the performance of Deeplabv3+ with and without CRF to see which one performs better.”

"the metrics include precision recall acurracy f1 score miou"

She definitely wants to use DeepLabv3+ as the main model.
Then add CRF as post-processing to compare “before vs after”.
she just wants the results to not look terrible and to show a clear difference between without CRF and with CRF.
The main goal is to prove that CRF actually has an effect, ideally making the hybrid (DeepLabv3+ + CRF) perform better.

She wants a clean pipeline: DeepLabv3+ baseline → DeepLabv3+ + CRF hybrid, show meaningful improvement, & make sure the results look good enough.

- and at the end do model evaluation in detail(f1 score, miou, recall, precision, both test and training accuracies, ROC, learning curve and losses curve, etc).
- as the classes are imbalanced in this so do use techniques for imbalanced dataset...
- also use hyperparameter tuning for CRF ...
